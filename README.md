# Basil Photobook

A full-stack web application that lets user create and post pictures to a communative and/or personal photobook. The design takes heavy inspiration from the video game Omori, which includes the feature to enlarge a picture and view it's journal entry by clicking on it. The application features real-time collaboration, secure image upload, and dynamic album organization that's been styled for both desktop and mobile view.
